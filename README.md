# *.msg Reader

My collegue sends me a lot of emails in the *.msg format. It's the format that "Old Microsoft Outlook" uses if you export an email or attach it to another email.  
I couldn't even open these files on my Windows 11 machine, because of an error that stated that I need an active Microsoft 365 subscription - which is confusing (or **very** wrong), because I have one and it's active in all other MS Office apps.

Since my collegue doesn't stop sending me these <3 and my Feedback to Microsoft a few months ago didn't do anything ðŸ’¤, I decided to take matters into my own hands.  
I wrote a small tool that can read these files and show them to me (about) how they are shown in email clients - with HTML and inline images and all.

I am currently writing with the Microsoft Support to get this issue fixed, but until then, I have this tool (and everyone who needs to open *.msg files and can't/wont afford a Microsoft 365 Subscription to open a fricking .msg-File).  

... also - WHY would you put a paywall in front of a file format that you created?

## Disclaimer
I'm not sure I remember updating this readme file if there are any updates to the Microsoft Support thing or if it suddenly works.  

It's just here to help. :)

Java app. Works, basically my favourite, but doesn't show inline images

[encryptomatic.com | Free Online .msg Viewer](https://www.encryptomatic.com/viewer/)  
Kinda sus. I don't really trust them, because they sell the ~same thing as a [product](https://www.encryptomatic.com/msgviewer/msgviewerpro.html). You also can't see inline images and you get an ad in the end of the email instad of in the page itself.

[GitHub | datenteiler/ReadMsgFile](https://github.com/datenteiler/ReadMsgFile)  
Seems to be ok, but it only shows the text version of the email. No inline images or HTML because it uses a command line interface.

Costst money and doesn't look promising.
